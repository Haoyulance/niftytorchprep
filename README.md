## How it works?

It installs `niftytorchprep` CLI tool that helps you prepare your data for *niftytorch* training.

### Install
```
python setup.py install
```

### Interfacte
```
$ niftytorchprep --help  
Usage: niftytorchprep [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  NIFTYTORCHPREP helps to get your data ready for *niftytorch* training. You
  can browse through your options below. Each one has respective help
  function.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  bids-files       Print types of files and their number per folder.
  bids-totraining  Takes data from BIDS_DIR and organises it in a training...
  bids-validate    Basic BIDS verification.
  qc-anat          Runs Quality Control (T1) from visualqc package and...
  qc-func          Runs Quality Control (Functional) from visualqc package...
  qc-getvisualqc   Installs visualqc from PIP.
